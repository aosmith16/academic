An introduction to data manipulation in R via **dplyr** and **tidyr**.  The workshop is aimed at graduate students who have been introduced to R but don't have formal training in how to work with data in R.  It covers making data summaries by group, filtering out rows, selecting specific columns, adding new variables, reshaping, and joining datasets. Along the way students learn how to use the pipe operator to chain several data manipulation steps together.  The workshop ends with time for students to practice their new skills.
