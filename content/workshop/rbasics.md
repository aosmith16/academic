This workshop introduces R to students by going through the steps to perform a simple analysis on data stored in three different datasets.  Along the way students learn how to read in three different kinds of datasets (TXT, CSV, XLSX), merge them, and explore the data with **ggplot2** plots.  Students are introduced to factors and working with missing values in R.  Special attention is given to using R help pages.  All work in R is done through RStudio.
