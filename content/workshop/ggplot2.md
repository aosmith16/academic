A basic introduction to working with **ggplot2** package in R for making graphics.  The first half of the workshop focuses on learning the syntax and terminology used in **ggplot2** while making simple, exploratory plots.  In the second half of the workshop we talk about controlling the overall look of a graphic for a "publication-ready" plot.
