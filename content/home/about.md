# About Me

I am currently working as an applied statistician at Boeing, working with engineers to answer questions and solve problems. My expertise is in designing studies to answer research questions, statistical approaches for analysis, and clearly conveying statistical results to domain experts. I have a blog about statistics and R topics at [Very Statisticious](https://aosmith.rbind.io/), which is presently on hiatus since starting my new role.
