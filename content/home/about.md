# About Me

I am currently the research consulting statistician for the College of Forestry at Oregon State University.  I consults with faculty and students in the department on a huge variety of statistical topics, from study design to analysis and through to writing up results and making final plots.  I blog about statistics and R topics at [Very Statisticious](https://aosmith.rbind.io/).
